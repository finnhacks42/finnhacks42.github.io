<meta name="description" content="This was a lockdown project to create some fun dinosaur resources for primary schoolers. The idea was triggered when a little parcel arrived from my wonderful Aunt with some (real) ammonite and Orthoceras fossils from her teaching days. The kids were enthralled so we looked at photos of T-rex claws and Megalodon teeth. Then I discovered that some museums, private collectors and research organisations had very generously made 3d scans of their fossils available online for free. I decided to make a mini-dinosaur museum in a box that the kids could share with their classmates when they returned to school (since excursions and museums were off limits for the indefinite future)." />

    <p>This was a lockdown project to create some fun dinosaur resources for primary schoolers. The idea was triggered when a little parcel arrived from my wonderful Aunt with some (real) ammonite and Orthoceras fossils from her teaching days. The kids were enthralled so we looked at photos of T-rex claws and Megalodon teeth. Then I discovered that some museums, private collectors and research organisations had very generously made 3d scans of their fossils available online for free. I decided to make a mini-dinosaur museum in a box that the kids could share with their classmates when they returned to school (since excursions and museums were off limits for the indefinite future).</p>

<p>To avoid overloading my storage quota for this site with 3d models of dino teeth, I’ve put this project up on its own github pages site. More details on how I made it, 3d printable stl files and other useful resources can be found there: <a href="https://finnhacks42.github.io/dinosaur-museum-box/">dinosaur museum in a box</a>.</p>
