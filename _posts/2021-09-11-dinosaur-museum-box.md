This was a lockdown project to create some fun dinosaur resources for primary schoolers. The idea was triggered when a little parcel arrived from my wonderful Aunt with some (real) ammonite and Orthoceras fossils from her teaching days. The kids were enthralled so we looked at photos of T-rex claws and Megalodon teeth. Then I discovered that some museums, private collectors and research organisations had very generously made 3d scans of their fossils available online for free. I decided to make a mini-dinosaur museum in a box that the kids could share with their classmates when they returned to school (since excursions and museums were off limits for the indefinite future).

To avoid overloading my storage quota for this site with 3d models of dino teeth, I've put this project up on its own github pages site. More details on how I made it, 3d printable stl files and other useful resources can be found there: [dinosaur museum in a box](https://finnhacks42.github.io/dinosaur-museum-box/).
